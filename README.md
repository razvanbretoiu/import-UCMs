# import-UCMs
This project help us to import another Use Case Maps usign jUCMNav tool. Also all the scenarios and variables are imported and we cand make the binding between Use Case Maps automatic with a specific file

The jUCMNav tool is a free, Eclipse-based graphical editor and an analysis and transformation tool for the User Requirements Notation (URN). URN is intended for the elicitation, analysis, specification, and validation of requirements. URN combines two complementary views: one for goals provided by the Goal-oriented Requirement Language (GRL) and one for scenarios provided by the Use Case Map (UCM) notation.
